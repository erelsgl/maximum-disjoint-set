rectangles client application
=============================

This is an HTML demo application for the maximumDisjointSet function.

It lets you move points around, and tries to find the maximum set of disjoint squares such that each square touches two points.

A certain version of this application can be seen [here](http://tora.us.fm/math/graphics/svgdisjointsquares.html).
